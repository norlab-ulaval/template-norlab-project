 ## Note for repository admins
 ### Release PR related
- Only repository admins have the privilege to `push/merge` on the default branch (ie: `main`) and the `release` branch.
- Keep PR in `draft` mode until all the release reviewers are ready to push the release. 
- Once a PR from `release` -> `main` branch is created (not in draft mode),  
  - it triggers the _build-system_ test
  - and it triggers the _semantic release automation_
