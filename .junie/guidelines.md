# Repository Guidelines

_template-norlab-project (TNP)_ guidelines and instructions

## Repository Description

TNP is a template repository for code-related research projects. Itâ€™s meant to help kick-start repository creation by
enabling software engineering research-oriented best practice.

## Prime directive:

Always comply with guidelines and instructions.

## Repository Guidelines Instructions

- First, review _A2G Framework Guidelines_ specified in
  `.junie/ai_agent_guidelines/framework/guidelines.a2g_framework.md` for additional guidelines.
- Then proceed with the remaining repository guidelines instructions.

## Repository Organization

- `.junie/` contains AI agent related files.
- `.junie/ai_agent_guidelines` contains _AI Agent Guidelines (A2G)_ with entrypoint at
  `.junie/ai_agent_guidelines/README.md`.
- `src/` contains repository source code.
- `tests/` contains tests files.
- `artifact/` contains project artifact such as experimental log, plot and rosbag.
- `tests/tests_bats/` contains N2ST bats framework files that are mainly used for unit-testing
- `tests/tests_dryrun_and_tests_scripts/` contains integration tests
- `utilities/` contains external libraries such as N2ST, NBS and a mock repository
- `utilities/tmp/dockerized-norlab-project-mock-EMPTY` is used for cloning a fresh copy of a mock
  super project from https://github.com/norlab-ulaval/dockerized-norlab-project-mock-EMPTY.git
  on test execution.

## Repository Terminology

- `N2ST` is the acronym for `norlab-shell-script-tools` library
- `NBS` is the acronym for `norlab-build-system` library
- `dockerized-norlab-project-mock-EMPTY` is a mock repository of how a user would install and uses
  TNP. We refer to this as a "_super project_."
