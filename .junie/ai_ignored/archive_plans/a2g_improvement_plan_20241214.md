## Phase 1: Critical Fixes (High Priority)

### üö® Fix 1.1: Resolve Terminology Conflicts

**Problem:** Inconsistent use of "super project" vs "A2G-super", "AI operator" vs "User", "guidelines" vs "instructions"

**Solution:**
```markdown
# Standardized Terminology (to be implemented)
- **A2G-super**: The repository using the A2G framework (replaces "super project")
- **AI operator**: The human user directing the AI agent (replaces "User")
- **Guidelines**: High-level principles and rules
- **Instructions**: Specific actionable steps
- **Directives**: Commands that must be followed
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create comprehensive glossary in `guidelines.a2g_framework.md`
2. Search and replace inconsistent terms across all files
3. Update validation checklist to include terminology compliance
4. Add terminology validation to automated checks

**Files to Update:**
- `guidelines.a2g_framework.md` (add glossary section)
- `guidelines.a2g_general.md` (standardize terms)
- `.junie/guidelines.md` (align with A2G terminology)
- `validation_checklist.md` (add terminology checks)

### üö® Fix 1.2: Resolve Testing Workflow Contradictions

**Problem:** Conflicting instructions about test execution order and failure handling

**Current Contradictions:**
- "Always execute all tests before submitting" vs "Unit tests must pass before integration"
- Unclear what happens when integration tests fail after unit tests pass

**Solution:**
```markdown
# Standardized Testing Workflow (to be implemented)
## Test Execution Order (All Workflows)
1. Execute all unit tests first
2. If any unit test fails: Fix unit tests, do not proceed to integration
3. If all unit tests pass: Execute integration tests
4. If integration tests fail: 
   - Analyze if issue is in unit-level code or integration logic
   - Fix identified issues
   - Re-run full test suite (unit + integration)
5. Only submit when ALL tests pass

## Failure Recovery Protocol
- Unit test failure: Fix source code, re-run unit tests only
- Integration test failure: Analyze root cause, fix, re-run full suite
- Never submit with failing tests regardless of type
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Update testing workflow sections in `guidelines.a2g_general.md`
2. Create decision tree diagram for test failure scenarios
3. Add specific examples of failure recovery procedures
4. Update validation checklist with clear test execution order

### üö® Fix 1.3: Standardize Branch Naming Conventions

**Problem:** Different naming schemes for different workflow modes

**Current Inconsistencies:**
- General: `[youtrack-summary]-[youtrack-id]`
- Supervised: `ai-agent/CURRENT-CHECKOUT-BRANCH`
- Autonomous: `ai-agent/[youtrack-summary]-[youtrack-id]`

**Solution:**
```markdown
# Unified Branch Naming Convention (to be implemented)
## All Modes
- Feature branches: `ai-agent/[brief-description]-[task-id]`
- Examples: 
  - `ai-agent/fix-validation-TNP-123`
  - `ai-agent/update-guidelines-A2G-456`

## Mode-Specific Prefixes (if needed)
- Supervised mode: `ai-agent-supervised/[brief-description]-[task-id]` with `[brief-description]-[task-id]` being the current checkout branch.
- Autonomous mode: `ai-agent-autonomous/[brief-description]-[task-id]`
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Update branch naming sections in all workflow documents
2. Provide clear examples for each scenario
3. Update `a2g_config.yml` with branch naming templates
4. Add branch name validation to checklist

### üö® Fix 1.4: Clarify Mocking Instructions

**Problem:** Contradictory statements about when mocking is allowed

**Current Contradiction:**
- "Never mock the test subject"
- "Always ask for authorization before mocking coding language built-in"

**Solution:**
```markdown
# Mocking Guidelines Clarification (to be implemented)
## Prohibited Mocking
- ‚ùå Never mock the test subject (the code being tested)
- ‚ùå Never mock core business logic
- ‚ùå Never copy source code into tests instead of using real code

## Permitted Mocking (with authorization)
- ‚úÖ External dependencies (APIs, databases, file systems)
- ‚úÖ System resources (time, random generators)
- ‚úÖ Language built-ins (with AI operator approval)

## Authorization Process
1. Identify what needs to be mocked and why
2. Document justification in test comments
3. Request approval from AI operator (supervised mode)
4. Implement mock with clear boundaries
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Rewrite mocking section in `guidelines.a2g_general.md`
2. Add specific examples of acceptable vs prohibited mocking
3. Create authorization request template
4. Update validation checklist with mocking compliance checks

Also, mention in testing strategy that you should not not test language builtin, therefor, builtin should not be a test subject.

## Phase 2: Structural Improvements (Medium Priority)

### üîß Fix 2.1: Simplify Guidelines Hierarchy

**Problem:** 6-level hierarchy is complex and requires multiple file lookups

**Current Hierarchy Issues:**
- Too many levels create confusion
- Priority resolution requires extensive navigation
- Circular references between documents

**Solution:**
```markdown
# Simplified 4-Level Hierarchy (to be implemented)
1. **AI Operator Direct Instructions** (highest priority)
   - Immediate commands and overrides
   
2. **Repository-Specific Guidelines** (.junie/guidelines.md)
   - Project-specific rules and requirements
   
3. **A2G Framework Guidelines** (guidelines.a2g_framework.md)
   - Core framework rules and workflows
   
4. **Specialized Guidelines** (auto-activated by context)
   - Language/tool-specific instructions
   - General guidelines as fallback
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Merge A2G-super-config into repository guidelines
2. Integrate A2G general guidelines into framework guidelines
3. Create clear priority resolution flowchart
4. Update all cross-references to reflect new hierarchy
5. Add hierarchy navigation examples

**Solution:**
```markdown
# Enhanced Error Handling Framework (to be implemented)
## Error Severity Levels
- **Level 1 - Recoverable**: Retry with alternative approach (max 3 attempts)
- **Level 2 - Configuration**: Request clarification, continue other tasks
- **Level 3 - System**: Report immediately, halt affected tasks
- **Level 4 - Critical**: Report immediately, halt all tasks

## Escalation Timeframes
- Level 1: Immediate retry, 30-second intervals
- Level 2: Document and continue, report within 5 minutes
- Level 3: Immediate notification, await response
